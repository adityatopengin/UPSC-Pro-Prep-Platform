Democratic systems require decision-making by ordinary citizens through voting and participation. This process engages the intelligence, judgment, and character of common people in governance. Unlike autocratic or authoritarian systems that rely on a single leader or elite group, democracy mobilizes the collective wisdom and moral agency of the entire citizenry. This is democracy's distinctive virtue.",
